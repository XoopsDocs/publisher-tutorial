# 4.4 Permissions

This tab shows detailed permissions for various aspects of Publisher.

There are several key sections for Permissions to:

- View Categories
- Submit Articles
- Moderate Article within each Category
- use special extra fields as a submitter
- use specific Text Editors provided by XOOPS
- search and rate articles
 
Let's discuss these sections in more detail:


### Permission to View Categories
![](../assets/perm1.jpg)
You have listed here ALL categories and sub-categories, and ALL groups of users. You can then select which group can see which category. 

For example, you could create a private group for paid subscribers interested in Antiques, and only they could see a specific Category dedicated to Antques. 

### Permission to Submit Articles
![](../assets/perm2.jpg)
The same as above, but you can decide who can submit Articles to which Category

### Permission to Moderate Article within each Category
![](../assets/perm3.jpg)
Here you can decide which Group can moderate which Category.

For example, for the Subcategory1 you can create a special Category called "Sub1-Moderators" and assign specific users to moderate it.
### Permission to use special extra fields as a submitter
